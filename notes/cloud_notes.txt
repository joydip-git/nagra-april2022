Cloud computing:
	virtulaization-based technology
	a network or the internet
	to create, configure and customize applications via internet connection
	remote servers on the internet
	to store and manage and access data online rather than local drives
	the data: files, images, documents, audio, video, application etc.
	includes: a development platform, hard disk, s/w applications, and database

what we can do using cloud?
	develop new applications and services
	storage, backup and recovery of data
	hosting blogs and websites
	delivery of s/w on demand basis
	analysis of data
	stream videos and audios
	etc.


why cloud computing:
	to reduce the cost and management of robust in house IT infrastructue

what are the characterestics of cloud computing:
	a. agility
	b. availability and reliability
	c. scalability: on-demand resources on a large scale
	d. multi-sharing
	e. device and location indepdence
	f. maintenance
	g. low cost
	h. services in the pay-per-use mode

advantages:
	a. data security
	b. low cost due to pay-per-use mode
	c. unlimited storage capacity
	d. mobility
	e. accessibilty
	f. back up and store data
	g. much better collaboration

disadvantges:
	a. internet connection
	b. vendor lock-in
	c. limited control
	d. security

service provider
machine: RESTful API (Representational State Transfer)
class Service [remote clas]
{
	public string[] getDbData(){}
	public string getSomeDbdata(int id){}
}
API matching feature: the request is mapped to proper API using the URL and the HTTP protocol method
web server

client:service consumer
Java application, dotnet application, python app
http://.../Service/ (GET)
http://.../Service/1 (GET)

HTTP: GET, POST, PUT , DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH etc.

JSON: state of data
{"name":"joydip", "id":1, "salary":1000}

<employee>
	<id>1</id>
	<name>Joydip</name>
	<salary>1000</salary>
</employee>

Loose coupling

components of cloud architecture:
A. client infrastructure: front end component, GUI to interact with the cloud
B. application: may be a s/w or platform that a client wants to access
C. service: manages which type of service you access

3 types of services:
1. IaaS: responsible for managing application data, midleware, runtime environments (AWS EC2), GCE (Google Computing Engine), Cisco Metapod
2. PaaS: windows azure, Openshift. is very similar to SaaS, but PaaS provides a platform for s/w creation, using SaaS, we can access s/w over the internet
3. SaaS: cloud application services. Google Apps, Salesforce Dropbox, Slack, Cisco webex

D. runtime cloud: provides execution and runtime environment for the VMs
E. Storage: 
F. Infrastructure: provides services on 3 different levels:
	a. host level
	b. application level
	c. network level: h/w and s/w components servers, storage, netwrok devices, virtualization s/w
G. Management: 
H. Security: 
I. Internet

how does exactly this cloud computing works?

different cloud applications:
a. Art: Moo, Vistaprint, Adobe Creative Cloud
b. Business: Paypal, Slack etc., Office 365
c. Back up and data storage: Google G Suite, Mozy, One Drive
d. Entertainment:
e. Social: LinkedIn, Twitter, facebook etc.

Security risks cloud comouting:
	Data Loss
	Hacked Interfaces and Insecure APIs
	Data Breach
	Vendor lock-in
	Increased Complexity
	DoS (Denial of Services) attacks
	account hijacking
	spectre and meltdown

Types of cloud:
	public: open to all, pre-per-usage. managed and operated by CSP (Cloud service provider)
	private: internal or corporate cloud. it can deployed using Opensource, such as Openstack, Eucalyptus
		NIST: National Institue of Standards and Technology (NIST) divides privte cloud:
		a. On-premise
		b. Outsourced
	HP data centers, EPC (Elastic Provate Cloud), Ubuntu
	hybrid: private +public, Google Application Suite (Gmail, Drive etc.), Office 365, one Drive AWS
	community: shared by several organizations of similar fraternity
